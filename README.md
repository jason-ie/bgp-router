# BGP Router

## Overview

This project simulates a basic BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) router in Python, focusing on the fundamental aspects of BGP operations such as routing updates, message handling, and network communication through UDP sockets. The router is designed to manage connections with neighboring routers, handle routing announcements, and make forwarding decisions based on BGP policies.

## High-Level Approach

The development of the router simulation involved:

- Establishing UDP connections between neighboring routers to simulate the network environment.
- Implementing BGP message types such as UPDATE, WITHDRAW, and KEEPALIVE to mimic the protocol's behavior.
- Designing a routing table structure to store network paths and applying BGP decision processes to select optimal routes.
- Handling dynamic changes in network topology by updating routing information in response to received BGP messages.

## Challenges Faced

- **UDP Communication:** Simulating the reliable communication of TCP with UDP posed challenges, requiring manual management of message delivery and acknowledgement.
- **Routing Table Management:** Designing an efficient structure for the routing table that supports quick lookups and updates was complex, especially when handling numerous routes and frequent changes.
- **BGP Policy Implementation:** Implementing BGP policies for path selection, such as local preference, AS path length, and origin type, required careful consideration to accurately model routing decisions.

## Key Features and Design Choices

- **Modular Design:** The router's functionality is divided into distinct methods for handling different message types, making the code organized and easier to maintain.
- **Dynamic Routing Updates:** The router can process routing updates and withdraws dynamically, adjusting the routing table as network topology changes.
- **BGP Decision Process:** Implements a simplified version of the BGP decision process to select the best route among multiple available paths based on BGP attributes.
- **Neighbor Relationship Management:** Stores relationship types (customer, peer, provider) for each neighbor, influencing the route advertisement behavior according to BGP policies.

## Testing

The router was tested using a combination of unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests were written for individual components like message parsing, routing table updates, and route selection logic. Integration tests involved simulating a network of interconnected routers to verify correct message exchange, route selection, and handling of network changes. Additionally, custom scenarios were designed to test the router's response to complex BGP operations such as path aggregation and dealing with conflicting routes.

### Test Configuration

Tests were configured using predefined network topologies and routing scenarios to simulate real-world BGP behavior. This included testing with:

- Different types of neighbor relationships.
- Various BGP attributes to influence path selection.
- Simulated network failures and route withdrawals.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational simulation of BGP router operations, demonstrating the protocol's core functionalities and decision-making processes. While simplified, the simulation offers valuable insights into BGP dynamics and serves as a basis for further exploration of routing protocols and network design principles.
